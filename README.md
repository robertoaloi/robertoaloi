### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Passionate about Erlang and property-based testing, I have been
working with Erlang technologies since 2007. Sicilian by origin, I am
now based in Stockholm where I work as a software engineer at Klarna,
providing a smooth purchasing experience to 85 million consumers from
205,000 stores in 17 markets.

The original author of tryerlang.org in a world where Docker
containers did not exist yet, I am now working on an Erlang Language
Server Protocol (LSP) implementation in my not-so-copious spare time.
